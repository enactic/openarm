# Leader-Follower Teleoperation

OpenArm supports 1:1 teleoperation from a **leader** arm to a **follower** arm in two control modes:

## Unilateral Control

The follower arm mimics the leader's movements using position commands. Simple one-way control with gravity compensation.

- **Pros:** Simple setup, excellent for free-space tasks
- **Cons:** No contact feedback; easy to over-push or misalign during delicate manipulation
- **Best for:** Open environments with minimal obstacles, lightweight and fast movements, tasks without surface contact

## Bilateral Control

Bilateral teleoperation enables **haptic feedback**. You feel what the robot feels. It exchanges both **position** and **force** data bidirectionally, allowing operators to sense the forces the follower arm experiences.

This produces **high-quality demonstration data** (motion + force) essential for imitation learning and contact-rich policy training.

- **Pros:** Precise contact manipulation, reduced operator fatigue, rich demonstration data (motion + force)
- **Cons:** Requires additional setup and tuning, needs stable communication
- **Best for:** Contact-rich tasks, force-sensitive manipulation, working with deformables, precision insertions, collaborative tasks near humans

### How Our Bilateral Control Works?
OpenArm's bilateral controller uses a **disturbance observer-based acceleration control** system for sensorless force estimation. This approach delivers accurate and responsive force feedback without dedicated torque sensors, enabling high-fidelity haptic teleoperation at low hardware cost.
