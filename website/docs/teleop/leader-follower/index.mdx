# Leader-Follower Teleoperation

OpenArm supports 1:1 teleoperation from a **leader** arm to a **follower** arm in two control modes:

## Unilateral Control

This is the **basic teleoperation setup**, where the follower arm directly mimics the leader’s movements through position commands.
It’s a **one-way control** scheme — the leader sends motion commands, but no force feedback is returned.

- **Pros:** Simple and robust; ideal for initial tests and free-space motion
- **Cons:** No tactile feedback, making it easy to apply excessive force or lose alignment during contact tasks
- **Best for:** Basic teleoperation, open-space manipulation, fast and lightweight operations without contact forces

## Bilateral Control

Bilateral teleoperation enables **haptic feedback**. You feel what the robot feels. It exchanges both **position** and **force** data bidirectionally, allowing operators to sense the forces the follower arm experiences.

This produces **high-quality demonstration data** (motion + force) essential for imitation learning and contact-rich policy training.

- **Pros:** Precise contact manipulation, reduced operator fatigue, rich demonstration data (motion + force)
- **Cons:** Requires additional setup and tuning, needs stable communication
- **Best for:** Contact-rich tasks, force-sensitive manipulation, working with deformables, precision insertions, collaborative tasks near humans

### How Our Bilateral Control Works?
OpenArm’s bilateral controller uses a disturbance-observer-based acceleration control system for sensorless force estimation.
This approach provides accurate and responsive force feedback without dedicated torque sensors, enabling high-fidelity haptic teleoperation at a low hardware cost.


:::caution Note
The above describes the concept of our four-channel bilateral control architecture, which is currently under development and shared only with our research partners.
We are actively working on a more robust and stable implementation for future public release.
The open-source version currently offers a classical position–force bilateral control scheme, suitable for basic teleoperation and research purposes.
