# Leader-Follower Teleoperation

OpenArm supports 1:1 teleoperation from a **leader** arm to a **follower** arm in two control modes:

## Unilateral Control

This is the **basic teleoperation setup**, where the follower arm directly mimics the leader’s movements through position commands.
It’s a **one-way control** scheme — the leader sends motion commands, but no force feedback is returned.

- **Pros:** Simple and robust; ideal for initial tests and free-space motion
- **Cons:** No tactile feedback, making it easy to apply excessive force or lose alignment during contact tasks
- **Best for:** Basic teleoperation, open-space manipulation, fast and lightweight operations without contact forces

## Bilateral Control

Bilateral control enables **two-way force feedback** between the leader and follower arms, allowing the operator to feel what the follower arm touches.

For detailed setup and configuration, see the [Bilateral Control guide](/teleop/leader-follower/bilateral-control/).
