# Bilateral Force Feedback Control

This section describes how to run bilateral control using the provided scripts.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Architecture Summary

The project uses a **multi-threaded structure**.

A custom class derived from `PeriodicTimerThread` is used to spawn and manage **three threads**:

- **Leader thread**: Handles control logic for the leader arm.
- **Follower thread**: Handles control logic for the follower arm.
- **Admin thread**: Manages coordination and communication between components.

Core control logic is encapsulated in the `Control` class, which supports both:

- **Bilateral control**: For force-feedback, master-slave style interaction.
- **Unilateral control**: For single-arm or open-loop operation without feedback.

## Control & Friction Parameters (per joint)

| Name | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Dn** | Damping in the controller (velocity-based) |
| **Jn** | Nominal inertia (used in observers) |
| **gn** | Cut-off frequency for observers |
| **Kp** | Position control gain |
| **Kd** | Velocity control gain |
| **Kf** | Force control gain |
| **Fc** | Static friction (Coulomb) level |
| **k**  | Sharpness of friction transition |
| **Fv** | Viscous friction (speed-based) |
| **Fo** | Friction offset (bias correction) |

### Friction Model

The following tanh-based model is used for friction compensation:

```text
tau_f = Fc * tanh(k * dq) + Fv * dq + Fo
```

## Running the Script

```bash
cd openarm_teleop
./script/launch_bilateral.sh right_arm can0 can1
```

### Arguments

- `right_arm` or `left_arm`: Specifies which arm to use.
- `can0`: CAN interface for the leader arm.
- `can1`: CAN interface for the follower arm.

If the CAN interfaces are omitted, the script uses the following defaults:

- For `right_arm`: leader = `can0`, follower = `can1`
- For `left_arm`: leader = `can2`, follower = `can3`

### What the Script Does

1. Validates the arm side (`right_arm` or `left_arm`).
2. Sets default CAN interfaces if not specified.
3. Generates temporary URDFs for the leader and follower using xacro.
4. Launches the bilateral control binary with appropriate arguments.
5. Cleans up temporary files after execution.

### File Paths Used

- Xacro file: `~/openarm_ros2_ws/src/openarm_description/urdf/robot/v10.urdf.xacro`
- Generated URDFs: `/tmp/openarm_urdf_gen/{v10_leader.urdf, v10_follower.urdf}`
- Binary: `~/openarm_teleop/build/bilateral_control`

:::warning[Important Notes for Bilateral Control]
- The **zero position** of the arm is defined as the posture where the arm is **lowered straight down**.
  Make sure the robot is in this position before starting control.
- Bilateral control requires a **high control frequency (500 Hz or higher)**.
  Ensure your system is capable of maintaining this rate in real time.
- Improper **gain settings** may cause **oscillation or instability**.
  Tune the gains carefully, especially when starting with a new arm or load.
