# OpenArm VR Teleoperation Overview

This project enables real-time teleoperation of the OpenArm robot using VR human body estimation streaming data.

## Key Features

- **7DOF Control:** Maps both position and rotation for natural and intuitive manipulation.
- **Gesture-based Gripper Control:** Uses VR finger distance for real-time open/close actions.
- **Scalable Mapping:** Can incorporate full arm motion (upper/lower arm) for more human-like movements.
- **Real-time Operation:** Runs at ~20 FPS with TCP data streaming.

## VR Teleoperation simulation

We are currently developing a real-time VR teleoperation system for the OpenArm dual-arm robot.
The current prototype is available for full teleoperation and control simulation at **NVIDIA Isaac Labs**, mapping **VR (Meta Quest 3)** hand and arm motions directly to the robot's end-effector for different simulated operations, such as picking and placing objects.

## What’s Next?

- **Integration with the real OpenArm hardware** to enable teleoperation in real-world scenarios.
- **Refined motion retargeting** for human-like arm movement using advanced IK and VR tracking.
- **Improved gripper control** and haptic feedback for better interaction with objects.

Stay tuned – real-world OpenArm VR teleoperation is **coming soon!**
