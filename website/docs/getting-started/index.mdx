# Discover OpenArm

**OpenArm** is an open-source 7DOF humanoid arm designed for physical AI research and deployment in contact-rich environments. All hardware and software are completely open-source and ready for you to build, hack, and deploy!

We're in continuous development and actively seeking contributors, research partners, and company collaborators to shape the next generastion of practical humanoid systems.

## Whats Unique?

- **Human-Scale Design**
  OpenArm is designed with human-like proportions and dimensions, scaled for a person around 160-165cm tall. This provides an optimal balance between practical reach and manageable inertia for safe, responsive operation.

- **Safety-First Architecture**
  Built with QDD backdrivable motors and high compliance, OpenArm prioritizes safe human-robot interaction while maintaining practical payload capabilities (6.0kg peak / 4.1kg nominal) for real-world tasks.

- **Built for Durability**
  Critical structural components use aluminum and stainless steel construction, ensuring robust performance for repetitive data collection and continuous research use.

- **Fully Accessible & Buildable**
  Every component — from CNC parts and 3D-printed casings to electrical wiring — is designed to be purchasable and buildable by individual researchers and labs, with complete fabrication data provided.

- **Practical & Affordable**
  At 6,500 USD for a complete bimanual system, OpenArm delivers research-grade capabilities at a fraction of traditional humanoid robot costs, making advanced robotics accessible to more teams and applications.
