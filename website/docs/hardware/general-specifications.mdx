# General specifications

## Key features

- 7-DOF robotic arm with degrees of freedom similar to a human arm
- Payload capacity of X kg per arm, X kg for both arms
- High backdrivability enabled by QDD (Quasi-Direct Drive) motors in several joints
- Safe and smooth form designed to prevent pinching and trapping
- Simple design with hidden cables and screws
- Fully open-source

## Architecture

OpenArm uses the DAMIAO 43 series and DAMIAO 8009P motors.
To efficiently achieve high payload capacity, different motors are selected for each joint from the shoulder to the end-effector.
To ensure greater rigidity and precision, motors equipped with cross-roller bearings are used in sections supported on one side.
Although the DAMIAO 4340 series is not a QDD motor, it was chosen to balance high payload capacity with a clean, compact appearance.

## General dimensions

OpenArm has a small human-like physique. The support pillars are made of MiSUMi aluminum frames, making it easy to adjust the dimensions and attach cameras, sensors, and other attachments.
The base plate has evenly spaced M6 taps, allowing it to be fixed directly to a table or other surface.
Each joint has a mechanical limit that restricts the range of motion for safety.
