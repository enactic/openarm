# Procuring Components

This section outlines how to source all required components for this project.
 :::info
 All the prices are mentioned in Japanese Yen.

## üì¶ Mechanical Components

We divide components into:

- [**Off-the-shelf Components**](/hardware/bill-of-materials/arm-off-the-shelf): Standard items with a part number.
- [**Manufactured Components**](/hardware/bill-of-materials/arm-manufactured): Machined on-demand using MISUMI‚Äôs MEVIY service.

All required components are listed in the Bill of Materials section, with model numbers and recommended sources.

---

### üõí Off-the-shelf Components

Most mechanical and fastener components are available as catalog items from **[MISUMI](https://jp.misumi-ec.com/)**.

**Steps:**

1. Go to **[MISUMI website](https://jp.misumi-ec.com/)**.
2. Enter the model number (e.g., `CBE4-8`) in the search bar.
3. Confirm dimensions/specs.
4. Add to cart and order.

:::note
No drawings needed for catalog parts ‚Äî model numbers are sufficient.

### üõ†Ô∏è Manufactured Components

Some components in this project are designed for custom manufacturing and are ordered through **MEVIY**, MISUMI‚Äôs automated 3D machining service.

There are **two ways** to place orders:

#### üìé Method 1: Upload CAD File

If you wish to review or customize the design:

1. Go to **[MEVIY website](https://meviy.misumi-ec.com/)**.
2. Upload the STEP file (available in **[our GitHub repo](https://github.com/enactic/openarm_hardware)**).
3. Select material, finish, and tolerances.
4. Review the quote and place order.

#### üî¢ Method 2: Use Project Model Numbers (Recommended)

We have pre-registered model numbers for all custom components. To order directly:

1. Visit **[MISUMI's search page](https://jp.misumi-ec.com/order/part-number/create)**.
2. Paste the model number provided in our BOM (e.g., `MVBLK-ASN-48S-4BGUX-L`).
3. The MEVIY system will identify it as a custom part.
4. Specify quantity and order (no CAD upload required).

:::note
This method ensures you get the exact geometry we've validated for the project.

### üîÑ Alternatives & Local Options

You may also:

- Source equivalents from other vendors (check specs).
- Manufacture custom parts locally using the provided STEP files.

## ‚ö°Electrical Components

This project uses a mix of off-the-shelf electronic modules and custom PCBs and wiring harnesses.
Below are recommendations on how to procure them.

---

### üõí Off-the-Shelf Components

Below are the recommended product links to be used with OpenArm 01:

- **[Power Supply](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004204524395.html)**: Output Voltage: 24V; Output Current: 15A
- **[USB to CANFD Converter](https://a.co/d/hIi0SI1)**
- **[Emergency Stop](https://www.monotaro.com/p/6001/0711/)**

:::tip
Always check product ratings, reviews, and delivery estimates. Buy a few spares for time-sensitive builds.

### üß© Custom PCBs & Wiring

For custom electronics, we provide pre-designed PCB layouts and wire harness diagrams.

#### üßæ PCB Fabrication + Assembly

**[JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)** can be used to manufacture and optionally assemble the custom boards:

1. Download the **[Gerber](/file/hardware/bill-of-materials/electrical/gerber-for-hub.zip) + [BOM](/file/hardware/bill-of-materials/electrical/bom-for-hub.csv) + [CPL](/file/hardware/bill-of-materials/electrical/cpl-for-hub.xlsx)** files from the project repository.
2. Go to **[JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)**.
3. Upload the Gerber zip file to get a quote.
