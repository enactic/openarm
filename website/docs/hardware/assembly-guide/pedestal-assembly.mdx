# Step 1: Pedestal Assembly

1. Place the base plate on a flat surface.

2. Place the 750mm 60x60 aluminum extrusion on the base plate, making sure the two holes on the longer side of the base plate stay clear and in front of the extrusion

3. Place one side bracket on each side of the aluminum extrusion
4. Ensure that the required T-slot nuts are already inserted into the extrusion channels

If they are not pre-inserted, you can still add them by carefully angling them into the slot and sliding them into place

5. Align the brackets so that the holes line up with those on both the base plate and the nuts in the extrusion
6. Using `M6x12` bolts, tighten each bracket by inserting bolts through the base plate and into the T-slot nuts in the extrusion

7. Align one right angle 30°-60° reinforcement bracket with both the base plate and the aluminum extrusion
8. Secure the bracket using `M6x12` bolts, fastening it to both the base plate and the aluminum extrusion
