# 2. Arm Casing
For a list of components with photos, see section [0. Components](./0-components.mdx).  

## Steps
All the steps below are demonstrated using the **left arm**.
1. [J1-J2 Casing](#1-j1-j2-casing)
2. [J2-J3 Casing](#2-j2-j3-casing)
3. [J3-J4 Casing](#3-j3-j4-casing)
4. [J4-J5 Casing](#4-j4-j5-casing)
5. [J6-J7 Casing](#5-j6-j7-casing)


## 1. J1-J2 Casing
The J2 cable must be routed through the J1–J2 casing. Fit it into J1–J2_B and then close the casing.

Secure the casing using four screws.

## 4. J4-J5 Casing
Before installing J4-J5_B, route the J4-J7 cables to the inner side of the arm. Lead them into the inner slot of J4-J5_B and attach the casing into position.
