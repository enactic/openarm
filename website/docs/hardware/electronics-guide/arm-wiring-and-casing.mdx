# Arm Wiring & Casing

## Arm wiring

0. This installation guide provides instructions for setting up the leader-follower configuration of the OpenArm system. The leader and follower systems are physically identical, with the only distinction being the end-effector configuration.

### Power

1. Each of the four arms (two leaders and two followers) is powered by its own dedicated power supply.
2. The system includes two emergency stop (E-stop) buttons — one for the leader pair and one for the follower pair.
3. Connect the power supplies of the two follower arms to a single E-stop button. Repeat the same process for the leader arms, ensuring that each pair is connected to its designated E-stop.
4. The two output cables from each E-stop should be connected to the corresponding hubs of the arms.

### Communication

For the USB-to-CAN converters, assign the CAN IDs as follows:
- CAN ID 0: Right Leader
- CAN ID 1: Left Leader
- CAN ID 2: Right Follower
- CAN ID 3: Left Follower

Connect the <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>**red wires**</span> to <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>**CANH**</span> and the **black wires** to **CANL**. Then, plug each CAN connector into the hub of the corresponding arm.
