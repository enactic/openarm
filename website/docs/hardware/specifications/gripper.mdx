# Gripper Specifications

## General Dimensions

Maximum distance between the jaws is 88mm. Maximum closing is when the two jaws are in contact.

## Mechanism

The rotor rotates 60¬∞ from the fully closed to fully open position. The motor's zero position is defined as when the gripper is fully closed.
Ball-bearing slider blocks and rails, combined with bearings at the linkages, ensure exceptionally smooth motion‚Äîideal for force feedback and bilateral control.

## Using your own End-Effector

OpenArm design is flexible and allows you to easily attach your own custom end-effector (e.g., grippers, cameras, tools) with minimal changes to the existing structure.

---

#### üîÑ What Needs to Change?

To mount a different end-effector, all you need to do is **replace the part `J8_B`**.
This part acts as the interface between the robotic arm and the end-effector.

Your custom `J8_B` should:

- Match the hole pattern and dimensions of the original for seamless integration.
- Include mounting features that match your end-effector's design.
- Maintain mechanical strength and alignment.

---

#### üìÇ Reference Files

To help you design your own `J8_B`, we provide [downloadable CAD files](https://github.com/enactic/openarm_hardware).

These files can be imported into most CAD software and serve as a starting point for customization.

---

#### üß† Design Considerations

When creating your custom `J8_B`, keep the following in mind:

- **Mounting Alignment**: Ensure that the center of mass and torque loads are balanced relative to the arm‚Äôs axis.
- **Cable Management**: Add holes, channels, or clips for clean wiring if your end-effector needs power or signals.
- **Manufacturability**: Keep the design simple enough for 3D printing or CNC machining.
