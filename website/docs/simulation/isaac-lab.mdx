# Isaac Lab Simulation

## ðŸ§  Overview

Welcome to the **OpenArm Isaac Lab Simulation Documentation**.

We are developing **reinforcement learning (RL)** and **imitation learning (IL)** applications using the **OpenArm** model in the **Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab** environment.
Our goal is to enable simple simulation, robust learning, and seamless **Sim2Real transfer** for robotic manipulation tasks.

All code will be released as **open source**.

## ðŸŽ¥ Demo Videos

Explore the performance of our OpenArm in three RL tasks:

* **Reaching Task**

## ðŸš§ Coming Soon...

We are actively working on:

* ðŸ§  Reinforcement Learning Code
* ðŸ¤– Imitation Learning Code
* ðŸ”„ Sim2Real Transfer Code

Stay tuned for updates!
