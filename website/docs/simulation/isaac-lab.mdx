# Isaac Lab Simulation

## 🧠 Overview

Welcome to the **OpenArm Isaac Lab Simulation Documentation**.

We use OpenArm to develop and evaluate **reinforcement learning**, **imitation learning**, and **foundation model–based approaches** within the **Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab environment**.
The OpenArm model and its associated code are currently released as **open source** and are **officially integrated into NVIDIA’s Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab ecosystem**.

All pipelines, environments, and related code are planned to be released as **open source**, enabling the community to **freely use, reproduce, and extend our work**.
Through this project, we aim to contribute practical simulation assets, training workflows, and benchmarks that can be directly applied to real-world robotic systems.

## 🎥 Demo Videos

Currently, four reinforcement learning–based environments using OpenArm are publicly available:

* **Reaching Task**
