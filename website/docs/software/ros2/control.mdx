# ROS2

To get started, follow this [Robot Description](../sdk/openarm-description) guide to install ROS2 first to setup and test the OpenArm description package which you will need for ROS2 control.

We recommend using [Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) on Ubuntu 22.04, but other options may work as well.  
Check this page for a non-exhaustive [list of alternatives](#alternatives-to-the-recommended-setup).

## ROS2 Control

The [openarm_ros2](https://github.com/enactic/openarm_ros2) repository contains a collection of packages for use with [ros2_control](https://control.ros.org/humble/index.html).

It abstracts away the hardware control to expose the arm as a interface that receives position, velocity, and torque commands and outputs joint states.

To get started, clone the openarm_ros2 repository, build the packages, and source the workspace.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/enactic/openarm_ros2 ~/ros2_ws/src/openarm_ros2
cd ~/ros2_ws && colcon build
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```

### MoveIt2

[MoveIt2](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/index.html) is a framework for manipulators that combines inverse kinematics, perception, and control.

After sourcing the workspace, launch a demo.

```sh
ros2 launch openarm_bimanual_moveit_config demo.launch.py
```

#### Motion Planning

Target positions can be set in the `Joints` tab in the MotionPlanning panel on the left. Alternatively, the targets on the arms can be dragged and rotated to a target pose, or the goal state can be selected from a list of preset keypoints under `Planning` > `Goal State`

The `Planning` tab provides a GUI to generate trajectories to reach a goal position. Clicking on `Plan` to preview the path is recommended.
