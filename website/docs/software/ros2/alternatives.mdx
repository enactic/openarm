### Distrobox (Linux)
On other distributions of Linux, [distrobox](https://distrobox.it/) allows for the use of Ubuntu through Docker or Podman.

After installing distrobox, run:

```sh
xhost +local:root
```

Then run the following command (you may need to [configure credentials to the Github Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry)).

```sh
docker run --env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  --volume /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
  --network=host \
  -it ghcr.io/enactic/openarm/ros2:latest-humble \
  /bin/bash
```

Inside of the container, make sure ros2 is working by sourcing the installation and running a RViz.

```sh
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
rviz2
```

### MacOS

If you are using an Apple Silicon Mac, it may be necessary to enable Rosetta for Docker.

Follow the instructions at [github.com/tiryoh/docker-ros2-desktop-vnc](https://github.com/Tiryoh/docker-ros2-desktop-vnc/tree/master). This will not be very performant, but is good enough for simple experiments.
