# Step 4: Setup Software

Now that your motor ids are configured, you can proceed to installing the OpenArm CAN library that provides the communication interface between your computer and the robotic arm motors.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the required system:
- Linux with SocketCAN support ([Install Ubuntu →](../ubuntu/))
- CMake 3.22+
- C++17 compiler

## Download the CAN Library

```bash
wget https://github.com/enactic/openarm_can/releases/download/{{OPENARM_CAN_VERSION}}/openarm-can-{{OPENARM_CAN_VERSION}}.tar.gz
tar xf openarm-can-{{OPENARM_CAN_VERSION}}.tar.gz
cd openarm-can-{{OPENARM_CAN_VERSION}}
```

## Build the Library

Build:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

If you want to use the library system-wide:

```
sudo cmake --install build
```

The library is now ready to communicate with your motors once the CAN interface is properly configured.
