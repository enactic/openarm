# Step 4: Setup Software

Now that your motor ids are configured, you'll install the OpenArm CAN library that provides the communication interface between your computer and the robotic arm motors.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the required system:
- Linux with SocketCAN support ([Install Ubuntu â†’](../ubuntu/))
- CMake 3.22+
- C++17 compiler

## Clone the CAN Library

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enactic/openarm_can.git
```

## Build the Library

Build:

```bash
cd openarm_can
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

If you want to use the library system-wide:

```
sudo cmake --install build
```

The library is now ready to communicate with your motors once the CAN interface is properly configured.
