# Dual Booting With Windows

You can install Ubuntu alongside Windows using a shared disk with partitioning.

### Step 1: Prepare Windows

1. Back up your data (just in case).
2. Open Disk Management (Win + X → Disk Management).
3. Right-click your main drive (usually C:) → Shrink Volume.
4. Free at least 20–50 GB for Ubuntu (recommended).
5. Leave the new space unallocated (do not format it).

### Step 2: Boot the Ubuntu USB Installer

1. Insert the USB and reboot the system
2. Enter BIOS/UEFI (usually by pressing F2, Del, F12, or Esc during startup)
3. Set the USB as the first boot device
4. Save changes and reboot

### Step 3: Install Ubuntu Alongside Windows

1. Select Try or Install Ubuntu
2. When prompted for installation type, select: **Install Ubuntu alongside Windows Boot Manager**
3. Use the slider to allocate how much space to give to Ubuntu
4. Continue installation as prompted

### Step 4: Bootloader Setup

1. After installation, you’ll see the GRUB boot menu at startup
2. Select between Ubuntu and Windows each time you boot

### Fixing Boot Issues

If Windows doesn't show up in the GRUB menu:

```bash
sudo os-prober
sudo update-grub
```

Or use Boot-Repair from a live USB.
