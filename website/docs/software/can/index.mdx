# OpenArm CAN Library

## Overview

The [OpenArm CAN](https://github.com/enactic/openarm_can/) Library serves as the primary communication bridge between high-level OpenArm control applications and low-level motor protocols.
It abstracts CAN bus communication via utilizing Linux's SocketCAN interface, providing an API for motor control and state monitoring. The library allows extensibility for various CAN devices beyond motors.

SocketCAN is Linux's implementation of the CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol stack, providing a socket-based interface for CAN communication.
For detailed setup instructions including CAN interface configuration, library build, and verification steps, see [Setup Guide](/software/setup).
