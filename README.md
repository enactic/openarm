# OpenArm: an open-source robotic arm for human manipulation data collection
OpenArm is an open-source humanoid robot arm designed for AI and robotics research in human-centered environments. Its modular hardware and accessible software make it a flexible platform for teleoperation, imitation learning, and real-world data collection. Our goal is to advance physical intelligence by enabling robots that operate safely and effectively alongside people â€” in homes, service contexts, and caretaking settings. OpenArm offers high backdrivability and compliance, making it well-suited for interactive, assistive, and data-driven tasks.

The project is under active development, and weâ€™re collaborating with researchers, developers, and labs to shape the next generation of practical humanoid systems.

## ðŸš€ OpenArm v0.2 (beta) Updates:
- **Gravity Compensation:** Smoother teleoperation with real-time compensation.
- **Force Feedback Teleoperation:** Unilateral and **bilateral control** with force feedback for better manipulation and data collection.
- **URDF Overhaul:** Improved default pose and model accuracy.

The core design files for OpenArm are available on [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/b4c9f28b9b00f7d40a1a4250/w/fe370058f6ecce02af3b0093/e/c7e7f88d1c11b5ea0a83ba7c?renderMode=0&uiState=67b590ed2d89b65cc3bf2317), including:
- CAD model
- Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Assembly Guide

Machined, sheet metal, and off-the-shelf components can be purchased through [MiSUMi](https://jp.misumi-ec.com/) and its manufacturing service [Meviy](https://meviy.misumi-ec.com/worldwide/en/), but similar services worldwide can also be used to procure the necessary parts.

## Software

### Arm Control
OpenArmâ€™s software stack includes real-time motor control examples, enabling users to quickly set up and start moving the arm. It also provides motor calibration tools, a SocketCAN driver, and a step-by-step tutorials on setting up the CAN interface.
- [Arm Control](https://github.com/reazon-research/OpenArm/tree/main/control)

### ROS2 Packages
Packages for camera integration, hardware bringup, and MoveIt2 can all be found under ROS2 packages. URDF descriptions for single and bimanual arm setups are also located here.
- [ROS2 Packages](https://github.com/reazon-research/openarm_ros2)

### Simulation
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38d35919-a526-4636-9b34-b4b4ad11a32e)
To set up OpenArm in simulation environments, example documentation for MuJuCo, MoveIt2 (ROS2), and Genesis are provided.

- [Arm Simulation with MuJuCo, MoveIt2, Genesis](https://github.com/reazon-research/openarm_simulation)

### Teleoperation
![DSCF3195](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bb219fa-276f-46a6-8c31-756a8cbc19bb)

To configure one set of OpenArms to act in teleoperation, the setup is provided in the Unilateral and Bilateral links.
- COMING SOON!
